# Be Pro Sise Blackjack Dealer Trainer

An interactive AI-powered training tool for aspiring Blackjack dealers. This application presents realistic game scenarios generated by the Google Gemini API, allowing trainees to practice payouts and procedures while receiving instant feedback and performance tracking.

## Features

This application includes a variety of training modules accessible from the sidebar menu:

-   **Challenge Mode**: A core training simulation with progressive difficulty levels focusing on specific blackjack strategies (Hit/Stand, Double Down, Splits, Insurance, Surrender).
-   **Audition Mode**: A timed quiz that tests all aspects of a dealer's knowledge, including strategy, math, rules, procedures, and etiquette.
-   **Hit & Stand**: A rapid-fire drill focusing on the most fundamental decision in blackjack.
-   **Card Counting**: Practice drills for both simple hand-total calculation and running count using the Hi-Lo system.
-   **Chip Payouts**: A hands-on module for practicing various chip transactions, including 3:2 and 6:5 blackjack payouts, making change, and color-ups.
-   **Dealer Talk**: Practice and get feedback on standard dealer verbal cues for various table situations.
-   **Be Pro Sise Groove**: A timed, music-driven challenge to test your speed and accuracy on chip payouts.
-   **VA Rules**: An AI-powered Q&A module for questions about specific Virginia live casino blackjack rules.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, "no-build-step" frontend stack:

-   **React 19**: For building the user interface.
-   **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Used via a CDN for rapid UI styling.
-   **@google/genai (Gemini API)**: Powers all AI-driven feedback, content generation, and evaluation.
-   **ES Modules & Import Maps**: The application runs directly in the browser without a bundler like Webpack or Vite. Dependencies are loaded via an import map in `index.html`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports ES Modules and Import Maps (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
-   A Google Gemini API Key.

### Running the Application

1.  **Serve the files**: Since this is a static web application, you need to serve the files from a local web server. You cannot open `index.html` directly from the file system due to browser security policies (CORS). A simple way to do this is using a tool like `serve`:
    ```bash
    # If you have Node.js and npx installed
    npx serve .
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use any local web server software.

2.  **Set up the API Key**: The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be available as an environment variable named `process.env.API_KEY`.
    -   The hosting environment where this app is intended to run injects this variable.
    -   For local development, you would need a mechanism to provide this. One common way is to use a server that can inject environment variables into the served files, but for a simple setup, you might need to temporarily replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual key. **Remember to not commit your API key to version control.**

## How the AI Works

The core of the trainer's feedback mechanism is powered by the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model).

-   **`getBlackjackAdvice`**: For the main Challenge Mode, this function sends the player's hand, the dealer's up-card, and the current game context to Gemini. It requests a JSON response containing the recommended action and a witty, persona-driven explanation.
-   **`getHitStandAdvice`**: A focused version for the Hit & Stand practice module.
-   **`evaluateDealerTalkCue`**: In Audition Mode, this function sends a scenario and the user's spoken response to Gemini, which then evaluates if the response is professional and correct, returning a boolean and an explanation.
-   **`getVirginiaRulesAdvice`**: For the VA Rules module, this function uses Gemini as a conversational AI to answer user questions based on a system instruction that primes it with knowledge of Virginia casino rules.
